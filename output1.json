It should be considered in relation to indigeneity, race, colonial and linguistic duality, regionalism, multiculturalism, multinationalism, and democratic principles, among other concepts. None of these perspectives can make sense of the country on their own, and even taken together, they still stubbornly resist any cohesive view. Our understanding can hope to be \u201cas Canadian as possible, under the circumstances,\u201d as the quip goes. <br>\n<br>This course is not a history of Canada although, ideas being steeped in the past, historical enquiry will figure prominently.

You can start with an introduction to the thesis (which provides context or explains why the message is important or of interest) but that part is not crucial. Finally, another important part of the presentation is formulating a few questions (usually one to three) that will be put to the group for discussion. As a presenter, you don\u2019t need to have answers to the questions. You should participate with your peers in the ensuing discussion. The evaluation criteria for the presentation are stated under \u201cEvaluation of Presentations\u201d under \u201cStart\u201d. They are: <br>\n<br>\u2022 Preparedness\n<br>\u2022 Relevance of notes\n<br>\u2022 Comprehensiveness of notes\n<br>\u2022 Quality of the presentation\n<br>\u2022 Capacity to create a discussion\n<br>The last criterion will determine if the questions were appropriate.

Can you go beyond the text and ask a question on how some of the author\u2019s claims shed light on current events in Canada?
